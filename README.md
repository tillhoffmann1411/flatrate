# flatrate

With this tool, residents of a shared flat can log in and rate flatmates applicants who have applied via wg gesucht. The name, profile picture, age and, the application message are displayed for each applicant. The residents of a shared flat can now rate the applicants and display an overview of those who have received the highest overall rating. To make the search easier, there is a simple text search and a filter according to gender. In addition, applicants can be marked as to whether they have received an invitation, been rejected or accepted.

## How do I get the applicants from WG Gesucht in flatrate?
Since WG gesucht does not offer an API, I have developed a scraper that can be used to feed all messages/applicants from WG gesucht into Firebase.
